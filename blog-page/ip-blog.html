    <h1>Whats an IP address?</h1>
    <br>
    <p id="secheading" ><strong>TL;DR</strong></p>
    <p>An IP address is an address in a network. You can address things on a network with it.</p>
    <br><p id="secheading"><strong>What can you do with an IP address?</strong></p>
    <p>With an IP address you can address other computers or servers or pretty much anything in a network. It is important to say that you need a uniqe IP address for every computer or router in a network. Lets for example take the biggest network in the world, the internet. When you go to a website like for example github.com, then your computer looks up the IP address of the server the website github.com is stored on, your computer does that by going to a DNS server and this server looks up the IP address for github.com or any domain. The DNS server then tells your computer the IP address of the domain that you searched for, in this case github.com, and your computer then addresses the server the website is stored on. The server the website is stored on, in this case the github servers, directs you to the starting page of the website.</p>
    <br>
    <p id="secheading"><strong>IPv4 and IPv6</strong></p>
    <p>IPv4 was the first kind of IP address we used, but it only allowed 4,3 billion uniqe IP addresses so in February of 2011 we ran out of IP addresses. This sounds dramatic but was acctually already known, so scientist prepared for this day and invented the IPv6 address. IPv6 addresses are made of hexadecimal numbers. With this we can give 667 trillion IP addresses to every square centimeter of the world, so thats devinetly enough for now.</p>
